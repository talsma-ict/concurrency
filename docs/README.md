# Context propagation library

Standardized context propagation in concurrent systems.

Provides a standardized way to create snapshots from various supported
`ThreadLocal`-based `Context` types that can be reactivated in another
thread.

## How to use this library

### Capturing a snapshot of ThreadLocal context values

Just before creating a new thread, capture a snapshot of all ThreadLocal context
values:
```java
ContextSnapshot snapshot = ContextManagers.createContextSnapshot();
```

In the code of your background thread, activate the snapshot to have all ThreadLocal
context values set as they were captured:
```java
try (Context<Void> reactivation = snapshot.reactivate()) {
    // All ThreadLocal values from the snapshot are available within this block
}
```

### Threadpools and ExecutorService

If your background threads are managed by an `ExecutorService` acting as a threadpool,
you can use the `ContextAwareExecutorService` instead of your usual threadpool 
to automatically take snapshots when submitting new work and propagating them
into the background threads.  
The `ContextAwareExecutorService` can wrap any `ExecutorService` for the actual thread execution:
```java
// private static final ExecutorService THREADPOOL = Executors.newCachedThreadpool();
private static final ExecutorService THREADPOOL = 
        new ContextAwareExecutorService(Executors.newCachedThreadpool());
```

It will automatically create a snapshot and reactivate it in the 
background thread when started.  
The ThreadLocal values from the calling thread will therefore 
be available in the background thread as well.

## Supported contexts

The following `ThreadLocal`-based contexts are currently supported 
out of the box by this context-propagation library:

- [ServletRequest contexts][servletrequest propagation]
- [Slf4J MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)][mdc propagation]
- [Locale context][locale context]
- [Spring Security Context]
- [OpenTracing Span contexts][opentracing span propagation]
- _Yours?_ Feel free to create an issue or pull-request
  if you believe there's a general context that was forgotten. 

Adding your own `Context` type is not difficult.

## Custom contexts

It is easy to add a custom `Context` type to be propagated:

1. Implement the `ContextManager` interface.  
   Create a class with a [default constructor]
   that implements _initializeNewContext_ and _getActiveContext_ methods.
2. Create a service file called
   `/META-INF/services/nl.talsmasoftware.context.ContextManager` 
   containing the qualified class name of your `ContextManager` implementation.
3. That's it. Now the result from your _getActiveContext_ method is propagated
   into each snapshot created by the `ContextManagers.createSnapshot()` method.
   This includes all usages of the `ContextAwareExecutorService`.

An example of a custom context implementation:
```java
public class DummyContextManager implements ContextManager<String> {
    public Context<String> initializeNewContext(String value) {
        return new DummyContext(value);
    }

    public Context<String> getActiveContext() {
        return DummyContext.current();
    }
    
    public static Optional<String> currentValue() {
        return Optional.ofNullable(DummyContext.current()).map(Context::getValue);
    }
    
    private static final class DummyContext extends AbstractThreadLocalContext<String> {
        private DummyContext(String newValue) {
            super(newValue);
        }
        
        private static Context<String> current() {
            return AbstractThreadLocalContext.current(DummyContext.class);
        }
    }
}
```

## Caching

By default the `ContextManagers` class caches the context manager instances it finds per
_context classloader_. Since the cache is per classloader, this should work satisfactory
for applications with simple classloader hierarchies (e.g. _spring boot_, _dropwizard_ etc) 
and complex hierarchies (JEE and the like).

### Disable caching

If however, you wish to disable caching of the context manager instances, you can set either:
- the java system property `talsmasoftware.context.caching`, or
- the environment variable `TALSMASOFTWARE_CONTEXT_CACHNG`

to the values `false` or `0`.

## Performance metrics

No library is 'free' with regards to performance.
Capturing a context snapshot and reactivating it in another thread is no different.
For insight, the library tracks the overall time used creating and reactivating
context snapshots along with time spent in each individual `ContextManager`.

### Logging performance
On a development machine, you can get timing for each snapshot by turning on logging
for `nl.talsmasoftware.context.Timing` at `FINEST` or `TRACE` level 
(depending on your logger of choice).
Please **do not** turn this on in production as the logging overhead will most likely
have a noticable impact to the context management itself.

### Dropwizard metrics
If your project happens to use [dropwizard metrics](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/),
adding the [context propagation metrics] module to your classpath will automatically 
configure various timers in the default metric registry of your application.
